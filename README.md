# GGJ 2017

My second attempt at a game for Global Game Jam 2017, theme is `Waves`, made with [love](http://love2d.org).

### Run

You can get the final distribution from the Global Game Jam site, [globalgamejam.org/2017/games/waves-13](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/waves-13)

Alternatively, with love installed, you can run the following (OSX);

```
git clone https://github.com/RaniSputnik/ggj17-2
cd ggj2017-2
/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love .
```

### Play

Left and Right arrow keys to stabilise the ship
